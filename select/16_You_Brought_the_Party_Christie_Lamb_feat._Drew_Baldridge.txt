I brought the coke, I brought the rum
I brought a few of my friends that like to have 'em some fun
I want a spot to rock till dawn
I even brought my guitar so I could sing you a song

But you brought the party
You brought the show when you showed up
Yeah, you got it started
I mighta put a little buzz down in your cup
But you brought the party

Yeah come on yeah
We're rocking now
You got all the boys looking, showing all the girls how
You brought that body, that come-on smile
You brought that oh-my-my, this night is gonna get wild

Yeah, you brought the party
You brought the show when you showed up
Yeah, you got it started
I mighta put a little buzz down in your cup
But you brought the party

When you walked in tonight you flipped that switch
From a regular time to as good as it gets

You brought the party
You brought the show when you showed up
Yeah, you got it started
I mighta put a little buzz down in your cup
But you brought the party
You brought the show when you showed up
Yeah, you got it started
I mighta put a little buzz down in your cup
But you brought the party
You brought the party
